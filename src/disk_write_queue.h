  The Disk write queue is a container that maps transaction ids to transactional
  items. It contains:
  - An map of transaction ids mapping to a vectoR of items belonging
    to the transaction.
  - When writers continue to add transactional items, the transaction
    is mutable, and once a commit comes in for the specific transaction,
    it is considered immutable and moved to another queue of immutablesQ
    and the flusher will be able to retrieve all those items.
  - While writers continue to add entries to the map, the flushers will
    work at clearing out the entries as and when they are deemed
    immutable.
