# Contributing to Forestdb

We look forward to your contributions, but ask that you first review these guidelines.

### Sign the CLA

As Forestdb is a Couchbase project we require contributors accept the [Couchbase Contributor License Agreement](http://review.couchbase.org/static/individual_agreement.html). To sign this agreement log into the Couchbase [code review tool](http://review.couchbase.org/). The Forestdb project does use this code review tool and it is also used to track acceptance of the contributor license agreements.

### Submitting a Patch

All types of contributions are welcome, but please keep the following in mind:

- If you're planning a large change, you should really discuss it in a github issue or on the google group first. This helps avoid duplicate effort and spending time on something that may not be merged.
- Existing tests should continue to pass, new tests for the contribution are nice to have.
